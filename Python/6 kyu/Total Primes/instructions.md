## Instructions

The number `23` is special in the sense that all of its digits are prime numbers. 
Furthermore, it's a prime itself. There are 4 such numbers between 10 and 100: 
`23, 37, 53, 73`. Let's call these numbers "total primes".

#### Task

Complete the function that takes a range (`a, b`) and returns the number of 
total primes within that range (`a <= primes < b`). The test ranges go up to 
10^7.

#### Examples
```
(10, 100)  ==> 4  # 23, 37, 53, 73
(500, 600) ==> 3  # 523, 557, 577
```
