# SQL Basics: Simple HAVING


## Instructions

For this challenge you need to create a simple `HAVING` statement, you want to 
count how many people have the same age and return the groups with `10` or more 
people who have that age.


### Schemas

```
people table schema
  - id
  - name
  - age

return table schema
  - age
  - total_people
```

Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the 
actual testing.
